      <description>** Evaluation**
For the evaluation the game was tested by two people (excluding the developer). They were asked to play the game for one round of the parcours and afterwards filled in a small questionnaire.
Game logs of the two tests and the scores achieved by the (more practiced) developer as reference:
&amp;ldquo;Time for Locomotion&amp;rdquo; describes the time needed to complete one round of the parcours excluding the time used for object interactions.</description>

      <description>** Implementation of Object Interaction**
There are three object interaction tasks within the parcours. Each spawns two t-shaped objects in random position and rotatin. One is slightly transparent, the other is opaque. The users have to rotate and translate the position of the opaque object to make it fit the transparent ones. In the end the accuracy is measured by calculating the offset of the different parts of the transparent object from the opaque one.</description>

      <description>Using Raycast to &amp;ldquo;blow&amp;rdquo; wind at objects
The decision to use Raycasts allowed for a more controlled handling of events compared to the Unity Physics - at least for me it soon became much easier to understand.
The raycast is implemented in the blowWind.cs script attached to the ventilator. I also attached a Line-Renderer-Component to the ventilator that visualises the ray for the players. The script differentiates between two kinds of &amp;ldquo;wind modes&amp;rdquo; that the players can change by tapping the touch button of the left controller.</description>

      <description>Implementation of Locomotion
Initially, I decided for a 3rd person player to reduce motion sickness. But after discussing the idea in class, I decided for a 1st person view as that allows for smoother camera motion. Therefore a kite has been added that should enable the player to use the fan to blow wind into the kite. The player then is attached to the kite.
The first idea was to make the kite follow the y-axis position from the Ventilator.</description>

      <description>Settling for an idea: Moving the player with a ventilator
After researching different modes of locomotion in animals and also taking some time with the idea to implement locomotion as it is presented in the Video Game form the Movie &amp;ldquo;Her&amp;rdquo;, I finally settled for a totally different idea inspired by the artwork &amp;ldquo;Objective Realities&amp;rdquo;.
&amp;ldquo;OBjective Ralities&amp;rdquo; is an immersive installation by the artist collective automata.farm in collaboration with the science fiction authorBruce Sterling.</description>

      <description>Brainstorming different modes of locomotion in animals to find inspiration for locomotion implementation in VR:
swimming: either by pushing away water with arms/legs or by body movement crawling: similar movements as in swimming, but on land flying: up &amp;amp; downward movement to keep up in the air walking/running: forward movement with legs/feet jumping And getting into how four-legged animals walk:
&amp;ldquo;It turns out that all four-legged animals step with their left hind leg followed by their left foreleg.</description>
