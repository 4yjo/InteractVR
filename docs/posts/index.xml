      <description>Implementation of Locomotion
alt text
Initially, I decided for a 3rd person player to reduce motion sickness (see Figure below). But after discussing the idea in class, I decided for a 1st person view as that allows for smoother camera motion.</description>

      <description>Settling for an idea: Moving the player with a ventilator
After researching different modes of locomotion in animals and also taking some time with the idea to implement locomotion as it is presented in the Video Game form the Movie &amp;ldquo;Her&amp;rdquo;, I finally settled for a totally different idea inspired by the artwork &amp;ldquo;Objective Realities&amp;rdquo;.
&amp;ldquo;OBjective Ralities&amp;rdquo; is an immersive installation by the artist collective automata.farm in collaboration with the science fiction authorBruce Sterling.</description>

      <description>*&amp;mdash; title: &amp;ldquo;Animal Locomotion&amp;rdquo; date: 2022-11-16T13:03:25+01:00 draft: false Brainstorming different modes of locomotion in animals to find inspiration for locomotion implementation in VR:
swimming: either by pushing away water with arms/legs or by body movement crawling: similar movements as in swimming, but on land flying: up &amp;amp; downward movement to keep up in the air walking/running: forward movement with legs/feet jumping And getting into how four-legged animals walk:
&amp;ldquo;It turns out that all four-legged animals step with their left hind leg followed by their left foreleg.</description>
