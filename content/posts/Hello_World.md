## Setting a focus for user-experience factors

Implementing interaction tequniques for VR is much different from other interaction. It incorporates a 3rd dimension and adds a real spacial relation of the player within the scene. Furthermore the input devices are directly connected to the player's body what increases immersion but also increases the risk of feeling uncomfortable during the game. 
I used the old and the new Oculus explanations that present the different ways the controllers can be used. My experience was, that I enjoyed the older instructions much more, as they are more playful and allow for experimentation. A good example to illustrate this is the introduction into the index-finger-pointing guesture.

 In the old version (left picture) a robot with similar hands is introduced who you shoud mimic with your own hands (holding the controllers). The robot points out it's index finger and an animated butterfly settles on top of it. If you did the same guesture, the butterfly settled on your index finger - if you did other hand movements like a flat hand or a fist, it did not settle. The experience was very calm and the interaction with the animated butterfly felt somehow special as the feeling of trust by the butterfly was suggested. 
 On the other hand, the newer introduction (right picture) focused more on the implementation and was very instruction-based, with text that explained how to do the hand guesture. The task changed from making a butterfly settle on your finger to pushing a huge button, which felt a bit uninspirational.
From my point of view, changing the instructions form mimicing a robot to following a written step-by-step guide introduced more barriers (like language-skills, the skil to transfer written instructions to movement, higher affordance to good vision, etc.). The overall setting of the new introduction was presented much cleaner and did not at all allow for curiosity-driven exploration.
 

For the implementation of my VR experience I decided to focus on the following aspects:
