**Brainstorming different modes of locomotion in animals** to find inspiration for locomotion implementation in VR:
- swimming: either by pushing away water with arms/legs or by body movement 
- crawling: similar movements as in swimming, but on land
- flying: up & downward movement to keep up in the air
- walking/running: forward movement with legs/feet 
- jumping



**And getting into how four-legged animals walk:**

 *"It turns out that all four-legged animals step with their left hind leg followed by their left foreleg. Then they step with their right hind leg followed by the right foreleg, and so on. Animals differ from one another only in the timing of that stepping."*
