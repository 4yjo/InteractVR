** Installation**
The Kite Interaction VR Game is implemented for Oculus VR Headsets and Tested on Oculus Quest 2. 
Use the .apk file (link on top of this page) to play the game on your VR-headset.

** Player Position **
The game is designed to play while seated. As the player turns their orientation a lot, an office chair that allows rotation is recommended but other chairs work as well.

** Controllers **

*Left Controller*
The interaction is implemented using the left controller only. 

- index trigger: Use your index finger to pull the index trigger. If the ventilator is directed towards the kite or an T-Object, you can "blow wind" at it with the index finger. 

- Touch Button: Next to the "Y" and "X" Buttons there is a small small touch sensor that reacts to your thumb. You can tap this to switch the "wind mode": The bigger air strem is meant to move objects as a whole, e.g. for moving the kite. The small air stream is implemented as giving small air-impulses that rotate the T-Objects.
